# Step 2 & 3: The dictionary automatically handles sorting by key (word) and reduction
    # If explicit sorting is needed (e.g., for a large file that doesn't fit in memory),
    # you you would sort the file externally or use more complex streaming algorithms.

    # Writing the reduced word counts to a new output file
